<p>Last week <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000006c196" href="http://www.fcc.gov/" title="Federal Communications Commission" rel="homepage">FCC</a> asked <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000000451e" href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" rel="homepage">Apple</a> and <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000008f0449" href="http://www.att.com/" title="AT&amp;T" rel="homepage">AT&amp;T</a> why the <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000042acea" href="http://google.com/" title="Google" rel="homepage">Google</a> Voice application for iPhone was rejected by Apple (read more <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usittelecomcompanyapplegoogleattfcc">here</a>).  Google Voice is a new service from Google (by invitation for now) where they give users a free virtual phone number that can redirect calls to users real phone numbers.  More on Google Voice and why this is good and useful later.<br />Up until recently there were a couple of 3rd party apps for Google Voice for  iPhone on <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000016f7c1" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="ITunes Store" rel="homepage">iTunes store</a>, which the sole mechanism to distribute apps for iPhone.  Google also developed an app of their own and submitted it to Apple to be publishing on iTunes store.  Amazingly enough Apple rejected Google's app, AND they even removed the previously published 3rd party Google Voice apps from  iTunes!  The reason given by Apple was that the apps duplicated the functionality already present on the phone!<br />Now FCC wants to know why the apps were rejected and removed, and also if AT&amp;T had anything to do with it.  Clearly AT&amp;T cannot be too excited about this service.  For one offers free SMS, and it also offers low cost international calls.  So, Google Voice presents competition and not surprisingly AT&amp;T does not like it.  This is not to say that AT&amp;T is the one who asked Apple to reject/remove the apps, but clearly one can see the conflict of interest.  It is hard to find a logical reason for Apple on their own to reject the apps as they didn't appear to cause any technical issues, or otherwise cause liability or concern of any kind.  Their presence seemed to be inconsequence to Apple (other than potentially at odds with the terms of their contract with AT&amp;T.)  At any event, the stated reasoning might, in my opinion, be construed as anticompetitive and conceivably illegal, at least in some jurisdiction.<br />When MS introduced the Internet Explorer and integrated it into their OS, they were prosecuted for anti competitiveness and lost the case in Europe (many argued they got away in the US).  It would have been very interesting if they had not allowed other browsers to run on Windows by claiming "similar functionality already exists" as an excuse.  But Apple feels this is not applicable to them.  Given the number of independent application developers, and the openness of the iPhone OS, and the number of units sold, Apple is now where exactly MS was back in those days.   Even if AT&amp;T has nothing to do with it, Apple should not be allowed to use this kind of logic.  And if it turns out that indeed AT&amp;T is behind it in some way (I must admit I cannot resist thinking that they are), then this is clearly a collusion, and in my opinion meaningful restrictions should be imposed on both to curtail future conspiracies  and to protect consumer rights.<br />Frankly, I don't see any reason for Apple to have any authority to prevent applications from being published, unless they cause technical issues that are harmful to the device in ways that implicate Apple.  AT&amp;T also should be prohibited from interfering with the app publishing process, except for the cases where the apps cause technical issues that affect to their delivery of their services or use their services over and above what the customers have already paid to use.  Loss of revenue to competition for either Apple or AT&amp;T should not be a consideration.<br />And that is how I see it ...<br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://blog.kermaani.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></p>
