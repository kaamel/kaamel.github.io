<p>According to the published reports Microsoft and Yahoo agreed to a 10 year partnership, subject to regulatory approvals.  Yahoo will drive the sales and marketing arm while Microsoft will be the technology driver with their new search engine: Bing.</p>
<p>Reportedly Microsoft will give Yahoo 88 percent of the search ad revenue made on its Web site over the next 5 years.  In fact for the first two years, Microsoft will pay 110%; that is an extra 10% out of their pocket.</p>
<p>So who wins?  Microsoft was willing to pay a "boatload of money" to buy Yahoo not too long ago.  With this new arrangement, they are only paying Yahoo 88% of the ad sales over 5 years.  Being the technology provider, Microsoft's search engine (Bing) will become the real IP and the Golden Goose in the partnership.  In effect Microsoft is buying the second position in the search engine market (after Google) with no cash up front.  Another way to look at it is that they are changing their original Yahoo acquisition plan to a try-and-buy.  If things don't work out, they will keep the money they were planning to spend buying Yahoo.  If they do, they will own the market share they were eying from the beginning.</p>
<p>As for Yahoo, they will be financially set for the next two to five years.  This will give their management a chance to work on other technologies and solutions.  If they the right vision and can come up with the right strategy and put together teams that can execute, they could create new business models that would work with or without Microsoft search engine.  If that happens they will survive, and might be in a much stronger position than they are today.  <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://blog.kermaani.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a>
