<p>I have been asked this question many times.  I recently posted my opinion on <a href="http://linkedin.com/">Linkedin </a>and wanted to share it here too.</p>
<p>Assuming both are available (in many areas in the US you get one or the other), then it boils down to price, performance, and reliability. This last one is a vendor thing and not (necessarily) a technology thing.</p>
<p>The state throughput of DSL (in most cases) is actually achievable while the cable bandwidth is shared with your neighborhood and seldom is realized, certainly not at the peak hours.</p>
<p>For both, one would usually (in the US) get a lower price for the first year, and assuming both are equal from the performance and reliability point of view it might be advantageous to switch annually, or at least threaten to switch, to get the best price. Generally the prices are very comparable. But sometimes cable companies bundle in some TV services for a lower total cost.</p>
<p>As for the performance, it depends on where you live. In my area Comcast (cable) and AT&amp;T U-verse (DSL) are both available and cost about the same. Comcast offers 16 Mb/s while AT&amp;T offers 18 Mb/s. I used to have Comcast (when they were faster than AT&amp;T) but their reliability was unreal (about 10 hours of downtime/month on average). I had measure 6-12 Mb/s (maybe even 16 Mb/s in rare occasions) in actual transfers from faster sites. I switched to U-verse about 6 months ago. It's reliability is solid (I have not noticed any downtime since I started the service) and its performance is very predictable and very good. I have even measured faster than the advertised speed of 18 Mb/s, but routinely get over 16 Mb/s (almost always limited by the site) when download from faster sites.</p>
<p>So in my experience it is a no-brainer: AT&amp;T U-verse (DSL) hands down.  <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://blog.kermaani.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></p>
