<p>There is a product called BodyBugg which is featured on the TV show “<a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f8000000000455412" href="http://www.nbc.com/thebiggestloser" title="The Biggest Loser: Couples 2" rel="homepage">The Biggest Loser</a>”.  For those who are not familiar, it is a little gadget that one wears on the back of their upper arm, throughout the day.  It has some sensors and a very accurate pedometer.  The sensors measure things like body temperature, the amount of sweat, and “heat flux” (whatever that means) and the pedometer counts the number of steps one walks.  Using all that information, the company behind this technology, <a href="http://www.bodymedia.com/">BodyMedia</a>, can calculate the number of calories burned, or that is what they claim.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever tried to control their weight can attest that such a tool could be invaluable.  BodyBugg does not directly show how much is burned.  It only collects and stores up to several days worth of data internally.  Using a personal computer the data will need to be downloaded to the BodyMedia servers via a Java application that runs in a browser.  By the way their <a href="http://my.apexfitness.com/">website</a> can track what one eats, which is then converted to calories too.  In addition it can track body parameters (weight and various body measurements).  And if that is not enough, depending on the goals, the websites puts together a suggested daily meal plans for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, as well as daily exercise routines.  Overall the combination of BodyBugg and this website is a very powerful fitness tool.</p>
<p>When I started using BodyBugg which I had received as a gift last Christmas, I noticed my calories burned at night when I was sleep was very close what one would expect by just calculating the resting metabolism rate (RMR) for an average person in my situation.  I always had experienced a higher calorie burned rate compared to everyone else around me and couldn’t agree with seeing  an “average” metabolism.  As I read more about the device I started picking up clues as how their website was calculating the results.  Based on that I modified some of my inputs (age, weight, etc) to achieve the expected RMR (more on this in a later blog, maybe).  After the adjustments I thought it did a reasonable job of helping me track my calories.  After several months of usage, my weight was relatively close to what the tool was predicting so I was fairly happy.</p>
<p>There were a few things that I don't like about it though.  First, it does not show all the statistical data that I am interested in and there is no (known) way of downloading the data into a spreadsheet that I can use to do my own analysis.  Also, I had to fake some data to make it work better.  I would have preferred if it could allow me to enter the RMR directly (one can measure their RMR in a clinic) instead of them using an aver RMR based on age, height, and weight.  Lastly, if their website is down (which happens a couple of times a month) one cannot use it at all.  In other words there is offline solution.  This can be problematic.  Lastly, there is no way to enhance what they offer any further as there is no way to interoperate with other online or installed fitness tools.  Whatever they offer is all get and there isn't much else you can do.</p>
<p>So, while I like what they have done, they need to do more.  There needs to be a solution for data portability.  They need an offline application that at a very least can function for a few days before needing to interact with their servers.   I wish they open up their APIs.  That could allow other vendors (or even the end users) to use the collected data to provide enhancements and functionality beyond the current scope.  And lastly, interoperability with other tools like heart rate monitors and GPS can take really BodyBugg to a different level.
