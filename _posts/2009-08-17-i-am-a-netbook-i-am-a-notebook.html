<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Have you seen those Mac commercials?  The question that I am asked these days more than Mac versus PC is about netbooks and notebooks.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">With the integration advancements the notebooks became more desirable than the desktops since they were portable and could do everything that the desktops did a year or two earlier.  The desktops became mostly specialty computers where typically higher end processing, and graphics, large amount of memory and disk space, larger (or multiple) screens, or some combination of these were required.  And then came along the netbooks to further enhance 3 aspects of the notebooks: the size and portability, the <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000000ac1e" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_%28electricity%29" title="Battery (electricity)" rel="wikipedia">battery life</a>, and the price.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">A typical <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000801c97d" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook" title="Netbook" rel="wikipedia">netbook</a> is measured less than 11 inches diagonally compared to more than 17 for some notebooks and weighs about 2 pounds compared to about 7 pounds for an average notebook.  This is a huge improvement for those who lug around their <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f8000000000159888" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop" title="Laptop" rel="wikipedia">laptops</a> all day.  And to save space, most (or maybe even all) of these netbooks use <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000045fbc00" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" title="Solid-state drive" rel="wikipedia">solid state drives</a> instead of mechanical drives which also weight less, are less noisy, and don't break (as easily).  But the smaller size is one of the most significant drawbacks too.  The keyboard is too small, for writing large documents and the screen size might be too small to be comfortable as the primary display. and the flash drives means less disk drive space which could become an issue for those who need to have a lot of files on their systems.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">The battery charge might last up to 8 hours for some of the netbooks versus 2-3 hours for a typical notebook.  For someone who is out of the office for most of the day this might a deal maker as a single charge could last the entire day.  The longer lasting battery is made possible by using lower power processors (and other low power consumption components) which achieve the lower power by reduce processing power.  For some applications this might not be a big issue while for others it will be.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">However, the last enhancement, the price, is the number one reason that attracts people to the netbooks in my experience.  They can be had for anywhere between (supposedly) free to about $300 in most cases, compared to $600-$3000 for notebooks.  The most intriguing the least understood part of the very low end of the price range is that part (or even all) of the actual cost is subsidized by the cell phone providers almost exactly the same way they subsidize the cost of the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone" title="Mobile phone" rel="wikipedia">cell phones</a>.  That means a two year (in almost all cases) contract to a wireless data plan for around $60 a month, which if you do math will cost $1,440.  If one needs the data plan (and some, but not all, do) then it is OK.  Otherwise this has be calculated into the total cost of ownership.  Additionally, the lower cost is achieved by eliminating or reducing some features (<a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000021482d" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" title="Graphics processing unit" rel="wikipedia">graphics acceleration</a>, processor, memory size, disk size, IO connectors, etc.)<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">So there is no clear "winner" here, at this time.  Many use their computers primarily to access internet and a netbook might be a perfect solution for them (that is why it is called NETbook.)  On the other hand some do a lot of intensive work on their laptops (spreadsheets, heavy document editing with graphics, charts etc, and other similar applications), needing large keyboard and screen size and lots of memory and disk.  For them a notebook is the right answers.  Which one is right for you?  Only you know the answer.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Down the road, the netbooks will displace the notebooks in much the same way that the notebooks have been replacing the desktops, although they might not be call netbooks.  We will be able to pack more functionality at a lower price into lighter laptops with larger screen sizes and keyboards, similar to the <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000000451e" href="http://www.apple.com" title="Apple" rel="homepage">Apple</a> MacBook Air, but at a much lower cost (closer to $300 than $3,000.)  They In the meanwhile, the competition between the netbooks and notebooks is bring down the price of all laptops, which is good news for the rest of us.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">And that is how I see it ...<br /></span></p>
