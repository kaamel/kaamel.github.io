<p>I was never called overweight, fat, or anything like that.  But as I was getting older I noticed that my pants size was changing.  In my latest upsizing, I was wearing size 34, and admittedly my belt was not exactly over my tummy, rather kind of below the widest part of midsection.  Otherwise I needed size 36.   And to make it worse, it seemed like the increase was accelerating.  Finally, one morning I decide to sep on the scale just to check things out.  We have one of these gadgets that shows the weight and the body fat percentage, although I don't think the fat percentage is very accurate.  It showed 165 pounds and 25% fat.  It was not terrible for someone who is 5'11", but I was inching into the overweight zone.</p>
<p>I decided enough is enough.  First I started reading a little about weight loss.  My daughter already was ahead of my by a couple of years (she actually was/is skinny, but you know how girls feel about their weight.)  She helped get started.  It became clear that I was not active enough.  I learned that most doctors recommend walking about 10,000 steps a day.  I bought a pedometer (actually I tried several before settling in) and noticed that I was barely getting to 1,500 on an average day.  The solution was easy: walk more.  I tried parking the car a little farther and stopped looking for shortcuts on my day to day chores.  Soon I added a daily routine of walking after lunch and then later after work.  It took a while but I did reach 10,000 steps.  The problem was that it was taking too much time.</p>
<p>The next move was to start going to the gym instead of walking and seemed to be a little more efficient.  Then I did the gym AND the daily walks.  I changed my diet too and started watching what I ate.  Labels are great and tell you everything you need to know.  My weight was clearly dropping by all measures, including my pants size.  My weight reached 160, then 155, and continued to go down.  I was wearing my older size 32 pants.  It took a while but I was actually wearing my belt right where it was supposed to be.</p>
<p>I started hearing comments and questions about my health.  "Are you OK?  You seem to be losing weight."  "Have you seen a doctor, you look weak."  "How is life treating you, are you stressed out?"  It was funny, but there were so many doctors around me who could diagnose my "disease" by just looking at me.  As I explained the situation, the comments slowed down or subsided all together.  Shortly after I was being asked about the details of what I was doing, as there seemed to be an interest.  I noticed that the number of people who were wanting to lose weight was rather large.  At the same time most were not impressed by my routine.  They wanted another solution that was so rigid and painful.  More like taking a pill in the morning or just before going to bed.  They wanted to heard that it is not what you eat, but when you eat it, or how to eat, or what else you eat to compensate.  Many decided that it is genetic and nothing would matter anyway.</p>
<p>By the time I reached my goal, I was going to the gym 3 times a week and walking for over an hour every day.  Because I was fairly active I could eat a lot of food and still not gain any weight.  I liked it a lot as I really enjoy eating.  Those who watched me eat like a pig and remain "sickeningly" skinny now were commenting that I "really" had to see a doctor as my body was not absorbing the food .  Which by the way I need to do for my annual checkup.  By the way, this morning the scale showed 140 pounds and just 7.5% body fat.  My pants size?  I am wearing size 30 and that is because I cannot find any size 29 pants that is 33" long.  It is a compromise that I have to make.</p>
<p>I must be sick ... And loving it.  <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://blog.kermaani.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a>
