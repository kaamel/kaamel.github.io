<p>There are so many issues with our health care system that no matter where we start it should not be too difficult to improve on it.  Yet there are so many interest groups that are living off the inefficiencies of the current system that any change will be resisted vigorously.  So I am going to ignore all the secondary issues, the ones created by those groups, and go right to what I would do.</p>
<p>Problems have to be addressed from the top, and that means the insurance companies.  They are feeding money to the rest of the <span class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000000744ad">health care system</span> and where ever they go, the rest will have to follow.  As a starting point I would remove any medical history, age, geographical location, or anything else from the basis of insurability or pricing consideration.  In other words they must offer insurance to everyone, and at the same price.  People could choose the insurance company and sign up by providing their name and sending in the payments.  Some will argue that the insurance cost for the healthy and young will go up, and in effect they would be financing the old and the unhealthy.  The fact of a matter is, everyone will eventually get old and unhealthy, so everyone would be paying the life time average cost, for themselves.  The competition would in the long run, if not immediately, bring the insurance prices down as all the insurance companies would have no choice but to take their total cost and average it, and then compete with each other on that average.  This is currently happing only for the youngest and the healthiest, and those are the ones that might actually not need insurance as much as the rest.</p>
<p>Then I would propose a basic national insurance that everyone would receive.  Something that would cost like $10 per visit for the first 5 visits in a calendar year and then %20 deductable, not to exceed a certain amount of out of pocket per year.  All insurance companies would be encouraged to bid on this national plan with no preset limit.  The lowest cost bidder would win and get to be the national insurer, and no matter how you cut it, make a killing.  The competition would be fierce which could make the bids very attractive.  To make it fairer, there might be schemes like up to 5 would win as long as a) they are within the 10% of the winner, and b) they agree to accept the winner's bid, or some other scheme.  This would help having multiple national insurance companies.<br />The insurance companies can also offer other plans to general public, for example lower deductable or lower percentage, or coverage for some semi-essential procedures (eye care or dental, for example).  People would be allowed to opt out of the national coverage and go directly with the insurance companies, but would get tax credit equal to what the base national cover would cost.</p>
<p>The cost of the national insurance would come from higher taxes from the employers (not employees).  No one likes paying for anything but we all want to be rich and beautiful.  In this case the employer would pay taxes instead of paying for employee health care insurance.  It should not be a huge burden.  I would argue that the cost of insurance will go down and as a result employers in the long run could be even paying less.  But even if they were not, this plan would guarantee insurance for all of us.  And it would be a lifelong insurance coverage independent of health, age, or employment status.  This would even render other forms of national insurance like Medicare, etc unnecessary and therefore make this plan less costly.  <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://blog.kermaani.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a>
