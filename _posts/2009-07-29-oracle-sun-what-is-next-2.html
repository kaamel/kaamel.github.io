<p>It will be interesting to see what Oracle will do with Sun once it takes over their day to day business.  I see 4 different pieces:</p>
<p>·         Solaris, Java, MySQL<br />·         Storage business, the old StorageTek<br />·         The x86 server business<br />·         The SPARC server business</p>
<p>Oracle was reportedly only interested in the first piece, initially.  My thinking is that MySQL will somehow be integrated into the overall database business.  Java is of value to them both internally and as a licensable product.  Solaris can become the primary operating system for their products.  I can see them optimize their products for Solaris, making it a very attractive technology for their customers.  They might actually market it as a viable alternative to Windows Server, going head to head against Microsoft.</p>
<p>The storage business is different enough that I don’t think they prefer to keep.  It could be a distraction and there is little synergy with their existing products.  My guess is that they will just sell it to the highest bidder or spin it off for now and sell it later.</p>
<p>The x86 server business will be intriguing.  With minor modifications to HW and Solaris-x86 they can offer an all-in-one platform (like Mac and OS X).  They can then optimize their products for that platform creating a unique package with practically no competition.  There would be minimal overhead in managing an x86 product line as it is a commodity hardware that can be outsourced easily.  On the other hand this can annoy the other HW vendors like IBM, HP, and Dell.  The might not not be a good thing for them in the long run.</p>
<p>The SPARC server business in my view could have been the least desirable part this acquisition.  The processors are mostly developed internally (by Sun) and it will take a ton of cash to continue the R&amp;D.  In addition the growth has been stagnant and would have likely been on the decline on its own, but could get worse if there is any perception of uncertainty.  I would think Oracle will try to sell the SPARC business but there might not be many takers.  The likely buyers should be IBM and HP.  They would consider it only as a means of getting Sun’s customer and migrating them to their own product lines.  There is at least one other viable buyer that I see, Fujitsu.  They currently supply the high end servers to Sun and are the only other company who has been investing in SPARC development.  Under this scenario SPARC might live for a while, or maybe even for a long while, as Fujitsu has the expertise to keep that technology advancing.  As the sole player in the SPARC market they could make enough money to make it a real business.  That could be a win-win-win, for Fujitsu, for Oracle, and for the end users.  <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://blog.kermaani.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a>
