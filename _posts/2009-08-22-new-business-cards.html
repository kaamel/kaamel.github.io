<p>A few years ago while attending a convention I noticed this self claimed consultant who was handing out his business card. I am using the word <em>card</em> rather generously here as they were clearly cut out of regular paper. Seemingly he had printed them on paper using a laser printer. It looked unprofessional, yet it was thought provoking. Why one needs a business card anyway and what do we do with them after getting them? In the old days when I used to have a note book for taking notes I taped them onto the page where I jotted down any notes from our meeting. In most cases I never went back to the cards. The phone numbers of the few whom I called back were transferred to my phone book (and later my electronic PDA or computer.) The rest were trashed or forgotten for all practical purposes.</p>
<p>Things have changed but not necessarily the principles. I only use paper and pencil to take notes when I don't happen to have my laptop with me. When I get a business card, I usually use it to read the name to make sure I got it correctly, and may be as a reference for the rest of the meeting. As for the contact information, I try to do an email exchange so we both can transfer the info (and in a way to verify the email address). From there we can move the relevant pieces easily to our electronic phone books. This works for me, although it is not as efficient as it can be. In addition, I wish there was a picture to go with the contact info. It is embarrassing when I meet with someone who I had met a couple of months earlier but cannot remember which one of the eight people whom I met with on that day he/she is.</p>
<p>Here is what I think would help. The new business cards should be similar the traditional ones on the front (kind for backward compatibility)! On the back, there should be a photo, plus a barcode with everything on the front side encoded in it. The recipient would use their smart phone to take a picture of the back of the card which then would be decoded and stored in the phone. From there the information can be transferred to (or sync'ed with) the contacts database on one's computer. Wouldn't that be neat? I would think so, but is it practical?</p>
<p><a href="http://kaamelk.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/example_biz_card_2009822191442.jpeg"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/example_biz_card_2009822191442.jpeg?w=300" border="0" /></a>Well, there are some solutions out there already. For example <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> has <a href="http://tag.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Tag</a>, an online application where it can create a barcode image from the provided information. Microsoft also has free applications for smart phones, including <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000047953d8" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" title="iPhone" rel="homepage">iPhone</a>, BlackBerry, <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f800000000002a8ab" href="http://nokia.com" title="Nokia" rel="homepage">Nokia</a>, and <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000001ea5a8" href="http://rim.com" title="Research In Motion" rel="homepage">RIMM</a> that can take a picture from the barcode and decode it. It worked very nicely when I tried it. By the way, the barcode generator is not limited to contact info. It can be used to encode free text, web pages (URL), and phone numbers. <a href="http://kaamelk.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/balloontag.jpg"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/balloontag.jpg?w=220" border="0" /></a>There is even a "custom" barcode option where one can convert the barcode into something that is more eyes pleasing. Microsoft Tag is still in beta, although it appeared to be useful even now.</p>
<p>I am not sure how long it will take for this idea to become common place, but sooner will be better than later. I for one will have my next business card with a photo and a barcode. Would you please do the same too? Oh, as for that consultant, I don't think this will help him, but I still think he should have spent a few bucks on normal business cards.</p>
<p>And that is how I see it â€¦</p>
