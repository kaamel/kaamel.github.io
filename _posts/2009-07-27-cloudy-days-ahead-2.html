<p>I feel it is more of an evolutionary step and therefore might have a slow adoption rate. New non-critical applications, the ones mostly used in schools and by individuals will help hammer out security, reliability, portability, and availability, and will also help establish the baseline for the overall value. As the more natural and more critical business applications penetrate into the CC, the acceptance will accelerate. As the more serious issues are addressed over time, the breadth of applications that can naturally move to the "cloud" will also increase.</p>
<p>In my opinion the six fundamental issues and obstacles that will need attention are:
<ol>
<li>Availability - the data and the applications should remain available when needed, even when there is no connectivity.</li>
<li>Performance - for the end users the perceived performance of CC should be superior or at least similar to using a laptop.</li>
<li>Security - The data needs to be protected and secure. </li>
<li>Portability - If the customers is not satisfied with a CC vendor (or in the worst case if the vendor goes out of business) the data and applications should be seamlessly portable to another vendor.</li>
<li>Low cost - the cloud route should be less expensive than buying a laptop and all the necessary applications, plus maintenance cost. The less complexity is good, but should represent one of the benefits and nothing more.</li>
<li>Device independence - the data and the applications should not tied to a particular HW or system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Google, Microsoft, salesforce.com, and others are already moving in this direction, although some are ahead of others. Storage in the cloud seems to be the leading application, followed by emails systems, and other similar online services. Microsoft has announced that Office 2010 will have a free online version. On the server side it is natural to run the database servers remotely, if the data can be moved quickly between the office and the datacenter. Desktop virtualization is another element that can connect the users to datacenters. Many other pieces are already in place or in the works.</p>
<p>The solution providers who can pull all these together and put together usable and simple solutions will get ahead. Who will they be? Time will tell. But if things are not worked out rapidly, there might be other technologies coming along and outdating CC before its times. <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://blog.kermaani.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></p>
