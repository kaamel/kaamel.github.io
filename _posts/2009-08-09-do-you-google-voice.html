<p>First things first, if you haven’t already, go to <a href="http://google.com/voice">http://google.com/voice</a> and sign up to get your Google Voice number.  In a week or two you will get an invitation.  You can then claim a free GV phone number, not a phone line, just a phone number.</p>
<p>What can you do with it?  You can set up the Google Voice to route the calls to your real phone lines like cell phone, home, office, or whatever.  You can even set it up to call different numbers at different times of day or different days.  It also comes with a voicemail that can be set up with different greetings for different callers.  And to top it off, it can transcribe the voicemails which can be read on a computer, emailed, or saved away.  And then there is the free text messages and lower international calling rates (calls from the US to the UK are only 2c a minute as an example.)  To use Google Voice to call out, one would enter the number on their website or directly on the cell phone if it is running the GV application.  Calls to any number within the US are free.  The app on the cell phones make the experience seamless.  (See my previous blog about the app for <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000047953d8" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" title="iPhone" rel="homepage">iPhone</a>.)<br />I like GV for several reasons.  I have started thinking of it as my permanent phone number.  When any of other numbers changed, all I would need to do is to redirect the Google Voice number to my new number(s) transparently.  Another benefit is that if I am somewhere with poor cell coverage where, I can have my GV reach me a landline number while I am there.  I can also have my calls go to my cell phone and office number during work hours, both home and cell phone during my commute hours, and only home, later in the evening.  Another side benefit is that I might be able to “read” my voicemail while “attending” a boring meeting.<br />Once I had my GV, I realized that I actually needed (or wanted) 3 GV numbers, one for my cell, one for home, and one for work.  You see, I don’t prefer to share a single number for everyone who might need to reach me.  There are times that I would want calls from everyone to go to the same number or some combination of home, cell, and office numbers.  But there are other times that I would prefer different calls to be routed to a different numbers.  As an example I don’t want my office calls to reach me over the weekend or after hours, and I don’t want my home calls to reach me in the office (most of the time).<br />So I used three different email addresses and got 3 different numbers.  And that is when I noticed a couple of flaws with GV.<br />First, GV refuses to allow more than one GV number to be routed to a cell phone number.  I am not sure why, but that is how it is.  It allows up to two different GV numbers to be routed to any phone number that is not a cell phone (this can be bypassed to claiming the line as landline, but then there would be no text messages for the line).  Both of these are somewhat serious limitations in my opinion.  I can see a not everyone in a family of 4 (and nowadays that means 4 cell phones) being able to route their GV calls to the home number.  And if there is a shared office number (in a small office setup for example, or when a single admin supports multiple managers) only two of the employees get to route their calls to that line.  And of course if there is a shared cell phone then all users but one would be out of luck.<br />Also, a couple of Blackberry users have complained about using the SMS feature.  In general, the incoming text messages are kind of weird as they show up coming from a strange number, although it kind of clarifies the actual senders, but still it is not clean at all.  I also I hear that the application on BB is not flawless yet (call connections are slow and at times don’t go through.)  But I cannot be sure if those are the app’s problem or GV, which by the way is in Beta at this point.  The thing I hear is that the transcriber is good but not perfect.<br />So, to sum it up, I would say it is an awesome service, especially since it is free.  But I also must add that like practically every other service that Google offers, there are some fundamental architectural issues.  The limitation on the number of phone lines is artificial, and reminds me of the current issue with the Contacts in <a class="zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000002b7d51" href="http://gmail.com/" title="Gmail" rel="homepage">Gmail</a> which don’t sync with Outlook, for whatever reason.  And the problem with the text messages reminds me of the “on behalf of” problem that Gmail had for a long time until it was fixed very recently.  I am not sure why, but Google seems to consistently go a long way in providing almost perfect services, only to leave a couple of key features out as if they want to make sure their services don’t dominate.</p>
